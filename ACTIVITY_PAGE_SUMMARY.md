# User Activity Page - Simple Summary

## What Was Built

We created a **User Activity** page that shows a timeline of all actions happening in the system - like a news feed of what everyone is doing.

---

## What You Can See

### For Admins and Superadmins
- **See everything** - All activities from all users (writers, clients, editors, support, etc.)

### For Support Staff
- **See activities for:**
  - Writers
  - Editors  
  - Clients
  - Themselves

### For Writers and Clients
- **See only your own activities** - What you've done in the system

---

## What It Shows

Each activity entry displays:
- **Who did it** - User's role (admin, writer, client, etc.) and email
- **What they did** - Description of the action
- **When it happened** - Date and time

**Examples of activities shown:**
- "Admin created a ticket with ID..."
- "Writer submitted order #109734"
- "Client sent a message about order 109718"
- "Admin canceled order 109721"

## How to Access It

2. **Or go to** - `/activity` in your browser

## What It Looks Like

The page shows activities in a vertical timeline format with:
- A chart icon (📊) for each activity
- Role badge showing who did it (admin, writer, client, etc.)
- Email address in parentheses
- Description of what happened
- Timestamp on the right side

**Example:**
```
